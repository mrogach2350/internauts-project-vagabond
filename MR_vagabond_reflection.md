How did your group approach the requirements? (mention anything unique or creative your group chose to do)

We whiteboarded out all of our routes, controllers, and methods at the beginning of every sprint. Once the initial scaffolding was established. We then parsed out the work into back-end and front-end. We broke into two teams of two and were able to complete much of the base app early. Then we identified specific features which were completed over the weekend, mostly individually. Finally, the final stages of styling and deployment were done together at the end of the project.   


What was easier than you thought? 

Creating a lot of styling from scratch. We used skeleton to grid our app, but all the buttons and styling were written in css/flexbox. We even found our own glyphicons for the buttons. 

What was more challenging?

Maintaining good version control. Early on in the project, we ran into severe issues using git and being able to successfully manuever between commits. Also, handling some of the merge conflicts proved difficult because we didn't always know when something was acutally deleted.


What is a lesson you will carry forward to working on Project 2?

Planning a lot at the beginning made for really smooth sailing. Our team was able to minimize bugs caused by overlapping code. Job assignments were clear and even better, team members were able to work on features and technologies they were interested in.

Shout outs for fellow students!

Zach - Styled the button movements by hand. Also, pretty much did all of sprint three with Sera (Authorization and Authentication, along with flash messages).

Sera - Put up the Mapbox, which looks and works great, also put Paperclip to allow for image uploading! As well as the aforementioned sprint three with Zach. 

Misha - Responsible for building up most of the routes and controllers. While all team members helped through out the duration of the project, Misha really had a good grasp on the CRUD functions of our app.
